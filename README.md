# Dog Breed Classifier Project

## Description

This project implements Convolution Neural Network (CNNs) to detect dog breed. Specifically, the project uses VGG16 to find the breed of a dog in given image.

A VGG16 model with transfer learning also implemented in this project. This pre-trained VGG1 model yields more accurate results.

#### Prerequisites

To run the project, ensure you have these installed:

- Python 3.6 above
- Web Browser
- PyTorch
- PIL
